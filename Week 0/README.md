#My RISC-V SoC Tapeout Journey!!

---
Welcome to my personal progress log for the VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program. This repository will serve as a detailed record of my weekly tasks, learnings and project milestones.

---
###PROGRAM OVERVIEW
This initiative focuses on a complete System-on-Chip (SoC) design flow, RTL to GDSII, leveraging a suite of open-source tools. I am a proud participant in India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout.

###üìÖ Week 0: Environment Setup & Tool Installation

**Objective:** To establish a fully functional development environment for the RTL-to-GDSII design flow.

**Key Tasks:**

* **Toolchain Installation:** Successfully set up the open-source EDA toolchain.
* **Verification:** Verified the functionality of all installed tools.

**Installed Tools & Their Purpose:**

* `Yosys`: For RTL Synthesis and Logic Optimization.
* `Iverilog`: For Verilog Simulation and Compilation.
* `GTKWave`: For Waveform Viewing and Analysis.
* `Ngspice`: For Analog and Mixed-Signal Simulation.
* `Magic VLSI`: For Layout Design and DRC Verification.
* `OpenLane`: A comprehensive tool for the automated RTL-to-GDSII flow.
* `Docker`: To containerize the design environment.

**Learnings & Progress:**
This week was crucial for building the foundation. I gained practical experience in setting up a professional-grade EDA environment on my system, ensuring everything is ready for the upcoming design phases.
